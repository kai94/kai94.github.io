title: How to Rank in the Top 2% in a Kaggle Competition using Deep learning
---

## Introduction.
I managed to finish in the Top 2%(28th out of 1440 contestants) in Kaggle's State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Competition[link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection).

The challenge in this competition was to categorize what the driver was doing in a given image.

Examples of images.
